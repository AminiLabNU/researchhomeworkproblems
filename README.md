## Motivation

Engaging undergraduates in research has been shown to have numerous benefits for them.  Students exposed to research opportunities have increased rates of retention in their undergraduate programs and increased interest in graduate school [[1](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1140384)], career confidence outside of academia [[2](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher-Madan/publication/256269033_The_Benefits_of_Undergraduate_Research_The_Student's_Perspective/links/00b7d5220d62626534000000/The-Benefits-of-Undergraduate-Research-The-Students-Perspective.pdf)], and increased skills in independent work, among many other benefits [[3](https://doi.org/10.1187/cbe.04-07-0045),[4](https://doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH05130-22)].  Although the benefits of undergraduate involvement in research are well-established, many students face barriers to participation.  Lack of knowledge and confidence in their own ability to participate in research, lack of exposure to research in coursework, and greater priority placed by institutions on coursework compared to research are frequently cited as barriers to participation, particularly among underrepresented groups and students of color [[5](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2022.104384),[6](https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci10090328)].

One approach to address the barriers discussed above is to provide resources to integrate research into coursework without significantly altering course structure.  To this end, researchers have developed a series of homework problems which can be integrated into existing undergraduate and graduate coursework.  Each homework problem is based on the work performed in the associated manuscript.  Students can read the associated research, and then perform the homework assignment with a better understanding of how fundamental scientific concepts covered in their coursework are applied to novel research.

This repository serves as a database to consolidate existing assignment problems available in the literature and as a guide for how you can contribute to this initiative.

## Guide to Writing Problems from your Research

The contents of this section provide general guidance on how to write an assignment problem based on your research manuscript and should not be considered to be restrictive.  Submissions will not be rejected if they do not meet the criteria below, but from the experience of the authors the following guidelines yield the most digestible problems for students.  Below are a set of "best-practice" principles for translating your research to a digestible problem:

- Consider starting at "back-of-the-napkin" calculations you performed during the course of the research you performed to validate your ideas.  Such calculations are generally approachable for a non-expert. For an example of this approach, see [Vargas et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crphys.2023.100102).
- Alternately, consider starting from an existing textbook problem in a relevant undergraduate textbook, and modify the context and problem formulation to reflect the research performed.  For an example of this approach, see [Jennings et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4067699).
- The problem should not require an exhaustive read of the manuscript.  Rather, the student should be able to gather the necessary context for the problem from a cursory skim of the manuscript and its salient takeaways.
- We encourage the manuscript to also contain a Non-technical summary [[7](https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2024-0151),[8](https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.175)] to increase the accessibility to students who may not have advanced knowledge in the subject. 
- If raw data is required for computing the results, the data should be included in the manuscript via an online repository or supplementary material.
- We encourage authors to attach their homework problem as an appendix to their manuscript and include the keyword "homework" for easier indexing of the available papers.

We encourage authors to also cite this repository in the section containing their homework problem to increase the visibility of this resource to other researchers engaged in teaching.
