    abstract = {In this study, we quantified differences in iris stiffness between female and male subjects in healthy and postlaser peripheral iridotomy (post-LPI) groups using an image-based inverse modeling approach. We analyzed anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images from 25 participants across four groups. Finite element models were created using **solidworks, **abaqus, and a custom C program, modeling the iris as a neo-Hookean material. We found that post-LPI females had significantly higher normalized elastic modulus (E′=3.81±1.74) than healthy females (E′=0.92±0.31,p=0.004), while no significant difference was observed in males. Post-LPI females also showed significantly higher stiffness than post-LPI males (p=0.003). Here, p denotes the probability value, with p\&lt;0.05 considered statistically significant. Our findings suggest that sex-based differences in iris biomechanics may contribute to the higher susceptibility of females to primary angle-closure disease. Despite the small sample size, this preliminary study highlights the need for larger, sex-stratified investigations into glaucoma pathophysiology.},
